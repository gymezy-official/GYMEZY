# GYMEZY Walk-in Model & Front-Desk Operations Specification

This document details the architecture, data models, customer resolution pipeline, front-desk counter payment flows, and turnstile check-in execution of the **Walk-in Operations System** across the GYMEZY platform.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview & System Purpose

The **Walk-in Model** allows gym owners, managers, and front-desk administrators to create single-session passes, group class bookings, and multi-tier memberships directly from the Gym Owner Portal for offline visitors who walk into the gym without having the GYMEZY mobile application pre-installed.

```

## 2. Source Disambiguation: APP vs. WALK_IN

Every booking and membership record on the GYMEZY platform explicitly tracks its origination source via the `source` field.

| Source | Enum Value | Initiator | Payment Channel | Initial Status | Pass Identifier Format |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobile App** | `'APP'` | Registered User on GYMEZY App | In-App Razorpay, Stripe, or Gym Wallet | `Confirmed` / `Active` | Sequential `BK...` or `MEM...` with Entry QR Code |
| **Front Desk** | `'WALK_IN'` | Gym Owner, Manager, or Staff Desk | Cash at Desk, Counter UPI (QR), POS Card Swipe | `Checked-in` (immediate) or `Upcoming` | Sequential `BK...` or `MEM...` with Phone Lookup |

### Source Constants (Single Source of Truth)

Defined in [`booking.model.js`](../middleware/src/models/booking.model.js) and [`membership.model.js`](../middleware/src/models/membership.model.js):

```javascript
export const BOOKING_SOURCES = ['APP', 'WALK_IN'];
export const MEMBERSHIP_SOURCES = ['APP', 'WALK_IN'];
```

---

## 3. Customer Identity Auto-Resolution Pipeline

Offline visitors often do not have an existing GYMEZY login. To maintain relational integrity and allow seamless account unification if the visitor later downloads the app:

1. Front-desk enters visitor's **Full Name**, **10-Digit Phone Number**, and optional **Email**.
2. [`walkInHelper.js`](../middleware/src/utils/walkInHelper.js) cleans and normalizes the phone number (extracting standard 10-digit format).
3. Database checks if a `User` already exists with this phone number:
   - **User Exists**: Links the walk-in booking or membership directly to the existing account `_id` and preserves their `customerId`.
   - **User Does Not Exist**: Automatically provisions a standard `CUSTOMER` record:
     - Sets `role: 'CUSTOMER'`.
     - Assigns clean phone, full name, and generated email placeholder if none provided.
     - Auto-generates standard sequential `customerId` (`GYZ0001`, `GYZ0002`, etc.) via Mongoose pre-save counter hook.
     - Sets a cryptographically strong random password for local account compatibility.
4. **App Sync**: If the customer subsequently registers on the GYMEZY mobile app using the same mobile number, their historical walk-in sessions and active memberships are instantly accessible.

## 4. Front-Desk Payment Settlement & Immediate Check-in

### Counter Payment Handling
- Offline visitors pay at the turnstile or front desk counter.
- Accepted payment methods: `Cash`, `Counter UPI` (gym's static QR code), `POS Card Swipe`.
- Payment status defaults to `Completed` with `paidAt: new Date()`.
- Financial amounts are credited directly to the gym's physical collections without triggering in-app gateway commissions.

### Check-in Behavior
The desk operator can select one of two entry modes:
1. **Check-in Now (`checkInNow: true`)**:
   - Booking `status` set to `Checked-in` / `Active`.
   - An `Attendance` record (`status: 'Checked-In'`) is created immediately.
   - Increases the gym's live floor occupancy counter.
2. **Upcoming Slot (`checkInNow: false`)**:
   - Booking `status` set to `Upcoming` or `Confirmed`.
   - Visitor can arrive later today or on a future date and check in by quoting their mobile number at the desk or scanner terminal.

- **Source Filter Tabs**: Filter by `All Sources`, `GYMEZY App`, or `Front-Desk Walk-in`.
- **Badges**:
  - `WALK-IN` in vibrant purple tag (`color="purple"`).
  - `APP` in classic blue tag (`color="blue"`).
- **Deep Linking**: Navigating to `/owner/bookings?action=walkin` automatically opens the booking creation modal.

### 5.2 Membership Management (`/owner/members`)

## 8. Pass Types, Duration Tiers, Active Sections & Personal Trainer Selection

Front-desk operations match the exact catalog, pricing tiers, and trainer availability rules established in the Gym Profile / Settings and the mobile application.

### 8.1 Membership Plans: Naming, Trainer Filtering & Start Date Selection

When an offline visitor registers for a membership at the desk (`/owner/members` -> `+ New Walk-in Member`), the operator configures:

#### 1. Membership Plan Tier (Standardized with Settings Page)
The plans displayed strictly mirror the gym's configured pricing tiers from the Settings / Profile page (`customPricingPlans`):

| Plan Name in Settings | Internal Tier | Duration | Base Price (INR) | Inclusions & Perks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly Plan (30 Days)** | `Monthly` | 30 Days | ₹1,299 – ₹1,599 | Standard gym floor access, peak hours access, lockers |
| **Quarterly Plan (90 Days)** | `Quarterly` | 90 Days | ₹3,299 – ₹4,499 | Floor access, locker facility, diet consultation, 1 guest pass |
| **Half Yearly Plan (180 Days)** | `Half-Yearly` | 180 Days | ₹5,999 – ₹7,999 | All gym facilities, free classes, shower/steam, nutrition guidance |
| **Annual Plan (365 Days)** | `Annual` | 365 Days | ₹11,999 – ₹14,999 | VIP all-access pass, sauna, priority locker, personalized regime |

#### 2. Personal Trainer Availability & Zero-Price Filtering
In accordance with platform standards (identical to the mobile app `BuyMembershipScreen`):
- **Zero-Price Filtering Rule**: If an employee/trainer has not set a fee for the chosen plan tier (i.e. `trainerPricing[tier] <= 0` or missing), **they are NOT listed in the dropdown**.
- Only certified trainers who offer active coaching for that specific tier (`trainerPricing.monthly`, `trainerPricing.quarterly`, `trainerPricing.halfYearly`, or `trainerPricing.annual` > 0) appear.
- The dropdown renders a clean trainer icon (`<UserOutlined />`) with the trainer's name, specialization, and their exact configured coaching rate:
  $$\text{Total Amount} = \text{Base Plan Price} + \text{Trainer Fee (from trainerPricing)}$$
- If the plan tier changes and the previously selected trainer is not available for the new tier, the selection automatically resets to **No Personal Trainer (General Gym Access)**.

#### 3. Start Date & Validity Computation
- The desk selects the **Membership Start Date** via a calendar picker (defaults to today, or can be set to a future date like the 1st of next month).
- A live validity banner immediately computes and displays the exact duration:
  $$\text{endDate} = \text{startDate} + \text{durationDays}$$
  *(e.g., "Membership will start on 04 Nov 2026 • Valid until 04 Dec 2026 (30 Days Total Access)").*

---

### 8.2 Session Bookings: Per Day vs. Weekly Plan vs. Custom Dates

For single-visit or short-term training (`/owner/bookings` -> `+ Create Walk-in Booking`):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Tier{"Session Duration"}
    Tier -->|"Single Session (1 Day)"| D1["1 Day Pass\n• Date: Selected Session Date\n• Base Fee: Single Session Price\n• Trainer Fee: trainerPricing.singleSession"]
    Tier -->|"Weekly Pass (7 Days)"| D2["7 Days Pass\n• Start Date to Start + 6 Days\n• Base: 7 × Session Price\n• Trainer: 7 × singleSession Fee"]
    Tier -->|"Custom Dates"| D3["Multi-Date Selection\n• Desk selects specific calendar dates\n• Generates N daily sessions & OTPs\n• Total: N × (Base + Trainer Fee)"]
```

1. **Single Session (1 Day)**:
   - Valid on the selected date for general floor access or a specific class.
2. **Weekly Pass (7 Days)**:
   - Sets start date and computes 7 consecutive days of validity.
3. **Custom Multi-Dates (`isCustomDates: true`)**:
   - Allows visitors training on non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri) to pick exact dates.
   - Selected dates appear as clean date pills with remove actions and a total count badge.
   - The backend attaches individual session records with 6-digit entry OTPs for each scheduled day.

#### Session Trainer Availability & Zero-Price Filtering
- Identical to `BookingSessionScreen` in the mobile app, only trainers with `trainerPricing.singleSession > 0` are listed.
- If a trainer has not enabled single session passes (`singleSession === 0`), they are excluded from the list.
- Each trainer option displays `<UserOutlined />` and their exact rate (Single: `+₹fee / session`, Weekly: `+₹(fee × 7)`, Custom: `+₹(fee × count)`).

---

### 8.3 Selecting Activity / Ongoing Sections
Front-desk staff can register walk-ins for open floor workout or direct enrollment into a live scheduled class:
- **General Gym Access (Floor & Machines)**: Standard single-session rate from gym profile (`singleSessionPrice`, default ₹199).
- **Active Gym Sections**: Loaded dynamically from `GET /api/v1/sections?gymId=:gymId`:
  - `Morning Yoga (06:00 AM - 07:00 AM) — ₹250 / session`
  - `Zumba Dance Fitness (07:30 AM - 08:30 AM) — ₹300 / session`
  - `CrossFit Conditioning (06:00 PM - 07:00 PM) — ₹350 / session`
- Selecting a section automatically populates `sectionId`, slot time, sets `bookingType: 'GROUP_CLASS'`, and updates the pass fee.
- All interface labels are standardized with clean typography and Ant Design icons without decorative emojis.

---

### 8.4 Payment Method Alignment and Session State Integrity
To ensure walk-in modal submissions never trigger `422 Unprocessable Entity` or Mongoose `ValidationError`:
1. **SSOT Payment Methods**:
   - Both `booking.model.js` and `membership.model.js` share the synchronized enum:
     `PAYMENT_METHODS = ['UPI', 'Card', 'Net Banking', 'Cash', 'Wallet', 'Online', 'GPay', 'POS', 'COD']`.
   - Controllers implement `normalizePayment(method)` to canonicalize incoming values:
     - `'Online'`, `'Card'`, `'POS'`, `'Card / POS Swipe'` $\rightarrow$ `'Card'`
     - `'GPay'`, `'UPI'`, `'Counter UPI / QR'` $\rightarrow$ `'UPI'`
     - `'Cash'`, `'COD'`, `'Cash at Desk'` $\rightarrow$ `'Cash'`
2. **Custom Dates Status Integrity**:
   - Schema `customDates.status` enum supports `['Scheduled', 'Upcoming', 'Attended', 'Missed', 'Reschedule_Requested', 'Reschedule_Proposed', 'Rescheduled']`.
   - New walk-in multi-date sessions are created with initial status `'Scheduled'`.
3. **Explanatory Frontend Error Messages**:
   - If a validation constraint fails, frontend modals extract detailed field violations from `err.response?.data?.errors?.join(', ')` rather than displaying a generic `"Validation failed"` notification.

---

### 8.5 Unique Sequential IDs and Gym-Scoped Collision Avoidance
To prevent MongoDB `E11000 duplicate key error collection: gymezy_dev.memberships index: gymId_1_membershipId_1`:
1. **Unified Gym Counter Key**:
   - Both in-app customer purchase and front-desk walk-in creation share the single source of truth counter key:
     `mem_${gym.partnerId || gym._id}` (for memberships) and `bkg_${gym.partnerId || gym._id}` (for bookings).
2. **Deterministic Pre-Save Collision Loop**:
   - `generateGymMembershipId(gym)` and `generateGymBookingId(gym)` verify `await Membership.exists({ gymId, membershipId })` prior to assignment. If a sequence number was previously generated, the counter auto-increments until a guaranteed vacant ID is secured.
