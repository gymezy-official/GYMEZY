# GYMEZY Gym Profile Management & Configuration Specification

This document details the complete data architecture, lifecycle states, permission governance, and cross-platform integrations for **Gym Profile Management** across the GYMEZY platform.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Gym Profile is the core multi-tenant entity representing a partner gym facility. It governs customer-facing discovery, pricing catalogs, operational schedules, KYC compliance, and settlement banking.

## 3. Gym Profile Lifecycle & Governance States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PendingApproval: Initial Registration & KYC Submission
    PendingApproval --> Approved: Super Admin Verifies Documents
    PendingApproval --> Rejected: Super Admin Rejects with Reason
    Approved --> Suspended: Account Blocked / Inactive
    Suspended --> Approved: Reactivated by Super Admin
    Approved --> Approved: Gym Admin Direct Updates (Live Immediately)
    Approved --> PendingManagerReview: Manager Submits Profile Edit (Delegation Enabled)
    PendingManagerReview --> Approved: Gym Admin Approves Diff
    PendingManagerReview --> Approved: Gym Admin Rejects Diff (Reverts)
```

1. **Initial Onboarding Verification (Super Admin Boundary)**:
   * Super Admin approval exists **strictly and solely** for partner gym onboarding.
   * Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/admin/gyms`, `PATCH /api/v1/admin/gyms/:id/status`.
2. **Routine Operational Profile Management (Gym Admin Autonomous)**:
   * Once approved, Gym Admin edits to hours, pricing, photos, and amenities apply directly to the database without Super Admin review.
   * Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/gyms/:id`.
3. **Manager Delegation Governance (`pendingManagerEdits`)**:
   * If a Manager edits the profile and `requireProfileEditApproval === true`:
     * Changes are saved into `gym.pendingManagerEdits: { submittedByName, submittedAt, edits: { ... }, status: 'PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL' }`.
     * Live customer-facing data remains unchanged until Gym Admin approves via the approvals drawer.
